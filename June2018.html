                <h3>Weekly Gathering</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Based on feedback gathered in the Dev Team meeting, we determined to use as much of the existing gathering content as possible in the fourteen week format for the September pilot.</li>

        <li>Content Revision Update: Weâ€™re into the level 3 reading and writing content and determined to just focus on revising this content because: a) it has never been peer-edited on a large scale like the listening and speaking content was, and b) the listening and speaking content is still in the A/V production queue and is not available for revision. 
        </li>
<li>Content Editing Update: Ted's team has completed the editing of the content received from Amy. The last of the scripts for the audio team has been prepared.  </li>
<li>Audio Update: The audio team is moving along and on track. 85-90% of the recordings are recorded. We should finish up in the next few weeks. They are waiting on the rest of the scripts to be edited.</li>
<li>QA Update: Seth and Ted's student team are completing the quality review of all completed units. They are also making revisions based on feedback from Christy Owens copy editing team.  Content concerns are being shared with Seth and Steve.</li>

                    <li>Heather's Schedule</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since December Heather has been filling the role of two full-time positions: EnglishConnect Director, and EnglishConnect Product Manager. Until they backfill her previous position as EC product manager, she is adjusting her schedule to rotate between EC1&2 meetings and EC3 meetings every other week.  This will allow for time in her schedule to work on assignments for both products. The week ending 6/1 is an EC1&2 meeting week. The week ending 6/8 is an EC3 meeting week.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Weekly Gathering</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>A few weeks ago, Heather, Seth, and Ted met in Rexburg and designed some proposed changes to the current EC3 Gathering. These changes will be shared at the next EC3 Council and Dev Team meetings. The key changes are:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>14-week semester based approach</li>
            <li>Structured to help students complete EC3 in 1 semester with 15 hour commitment.</li>
            <li>Recogonize the need for multiple semesters of Gather content to support students who take longner.</li>
            <li>More oppurtunities to have model based practice.</li>

        </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <li>We have received all reading and writing functional practice from Hawaii. 
        </li>
<li>Editing Update: Since the editors contracts have ended, final editing of remaining proficiency checks, listening units, and speaking units has been passed over to Ted's team.</li>
<li>Audio Update: The audio team is moving along and on track. 85-90% of the recordings are recorded. We should finish up in the next few weeks. They are waiting on the rest of the scripts to be edited.</li>
